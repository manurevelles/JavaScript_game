                    <span class="golden">3.</span> The correct path in the forgotten forest is: <b>RIGHT > UP > UP</b>
                    With your newly acquired <em>magic</em> (press SPACE to activate), you are more powerful against enemies. Take advantage of this in your combat.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="golden">4.</span> Now it's time to head to the <b>mountain</b>. 
                    Go left from the entrance of the forgotten forest and you will get to the <b>lumberjack</b>. He will talk about some old magic used on the spikes blocking the entrance... could that be your new <em>magic</em>?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="golden">5.</span> At the top of the mountain kill the cyclope enemies to deactivate the <b>ice artifact</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="golden">6.</span> Head south from town to the <b>desert</b> and enter the area with the <b>fire artifact</b>.
                    That mass of enemies shouldn't be any problem with your <em>magic</em>.
                    The gate to the castle should now be open.
                    Make sure to visit the <b class="underline">shop</b> in town before heading to the final battle.
