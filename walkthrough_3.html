                <p>
                    The <b>Dark Lord</b> has a lot of power and health.
                    To add to it, he summons randomized monsters every now and then. Try to take advantage of this to get some health back from dropped hearts. <br />
                </p>
                <p>
                    His main attack is shooting <em>magic bullets</em> in a circular pattern. Try to dodge them as much as possible. 
                    Note that as his health goes down, he gets more aggressive and the bullets don't follow a pattern.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Try to get to the final moments of the battle with as much health as possible. When his health is very low, know that he will move while shooting bullets... and he won't stop shooting bullets at all.
